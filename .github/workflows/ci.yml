    # Use official playwright docker image, which already includes browsers and related system dependencies.
    # By doing this ci time we can skip the following step:
    #
    # ```yml
    # - name: Install Playwright Browsers
    #   run: pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps
    # ```
    #
    # By doing so job execution time is reduced by ~20s
